	<h2>Welcome to 2021-22!</h2>
	<h3>10.03.21</h3>
	<h4>Introduction</h4>	
	<p>Welcome all members, new or returning, to 2021-22! We're all super excited to finally have the chance to hold
	meetings in person. Seriously, I don't think I can stress how cool it was to see all of your faces during the first
	in person meeting we had, it's like a dream come true. I'm making this post to give you all an update on how the club
	is doing.</p>

	<h4>Changes to Meeting Structure</h4>
	<p>This is the first year we've been able to have in person meetings, thus there will be a revamped meeting structure
	put into place. First of all, the Discord is being deleted, we don't need it anymore. All short term communications will
	be done through Google Classroom or phone. Any larger communications will happen through this website, so make sure to check
	it every so often. Before the meeting starts, Ryan and Mannan will come with meeting minutes on a HedgeDoc, letting everyone 
	know what the follow meeting will look like. As the meeting progresses, this HedgeDoc will be filled out and posted after the
	meeting in its completed state. If you miss a meeting, please make sure to check the previous meeting's minutes. Now that all
	of this bloat is out of the way, we can get to the fun part.</p>

	<h4>Club Activities</h4>
	<p>When we started this club in 2019, the goal was to give those who wanted to talk about and work on software a place to do
	so. Now that we're in person again, the admins have come up with a few guiding activities to help facilitate interesting
	output. The first idea is the <b>Communal Project</b>. The plan is to come up with a long term project that cannot be acomplished
	by just one person. This project also needs to have a diversity of topics covered. After assigning roles, we will work on or give
	updates on what we did relating to the project. The idea is for us to learn about new stuff, work with new people and end up with
	something cool when all is said and done. If you need an example, go on Mannan's website and look at the weather project plan. The
	second idea is working on <b>CTFs</b>, otherwise known as "Capture the Flag" challenges. In essence, these are hacking simulations
	where the challenge is to get some code, and you can see if you got it right or wrong. If you're a freshman right now, you might
	remember doing one of these during the Hackathon Club's workshop last year. We're probably going to be doing more advanced stuff
	than that. CTFs are usually pretty inidividual activities, but communication can help a lot. The current thought is to have a "CTF
	Day" every few weeks. The third idea was <b>to share personal projects</b>, much like last year. This is self-explanitory. We are
	compiling a list of Hackathons near us, and it will be posted on the website soon. Hopefully there is more participation and we
	all see eachother at these events.</p>

	<h4>Concluding Thoughts</h4>
	<p>If you're new: welcome. If you're returning: welcome back. I hope we all have a great year. Make sure to come to meetings
	prepared, and make sure you put in your best effort. Make sure to join the Google Classroom and come back to this website every
	now and then. Please read all of the Google Classroom posts, if we post a form, it's for the benefit of the club. Thanks for being
	with us everyone. We all hope to see you next meeting</p>


	<h2>Updates to the Club</h2>
	<h3>2.14.22<h3>
	<p>We sat in a circle and talked to Elon about what we wanted to do today. We ended up not doing anything productive 
		and legit set up our rasberry pie, something we should have done like 3 weeks ago</p>
	<h3>2.26.21</h3>
	<h4>Introduction</h4>
	<p>It's become clear to the club members and leadership that membership and attendance have been falling steadily 
	since operations started up in September. We can attribute this to a number of factors including the continuation of
	virtual school, low exposure, lack of interest given our current meeting model among other things. The executives
	have concluded that if we continue in this trajectory, the club cannot live to see the end of 2021. It is for this
	reason that we have decided to bring some sweeping changes to how the club will be managed and run in the future.</p>
	
	<h4>Changes to Meeting Structure</h4>
	<p>When the club's design was in it's infancy during the 2019-20 school year, it was intended that we would meet in
	person to learn various concepts together. Since then, we've experienced a pandemic which threw a whole wrench into
	that idea. So far, all we've done is adapt that initially dated idea to Discord, which obviously doesn't yield the
	same participation and interest as conducting meetings in person would. In light of this, the club will be taking a
	new direction in terms of meeting structure. Instead of teaching, the meetings will be used as a showcase of progress
	made outside of the club time. The showcase will include demos, explanations, presentations and more. The idea is that
	club members can pick up a project and work on it outside of the club, then present progress during the meetings. This
	provides a great transition for when we come back in person, promotes productivity and should yield a lot more
	engagement than our current instruction based model. All of the learning is going to come as a result of the learning
	while doing process instead. We wanted this club to be fun, not work, and this is the best way to realize that.</p>

	<h4>What About Hackathons?</h4>
	<p>We're called the hackathon club since we wanted to attend hacakthons as a group, but obviously the pandemic threw a
	wrench into that idea too. We've compensated with the mini hackathons and signing up for HackPHS and competing, but
	it has become clear that just doing those things isn't enough to sustain the club. We've appointed a new person to
	sign up for hackathons on behalf of the club and hopefully this should streamline the process of competeing in the
	in more events in the near future. This should also be a partial fix to the slowing of new members joining the club
	and the lack of exposure we have as of now. CTF challenges will also be promoted during the club meeting time.</p>

	<h4>Closing Thoughts</h4>
	<p>We've gone over a lot of changes here, and there are many more to come, we want this club to stay afloat after
	2022 for others to enjoy. We came in with high ambitions, and we're not ready to give up on them yet. You can do your
	part in improving the club by providing feedback to any of the executives at any time. We'd also like you to fill out
	the form at the bottom of this page so that we can get an idea of what we can change short term. Thanks for reading.</p>
